### Quality-of-Life Nitpicks

1. **Tooltips**: Provide brief descriptions for each menu item when hovered over.

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions (e.g., Ctrl+S for Save).

3. **Undo/Redo Buttons**: Include easy access to undo and redo actions directly in the menu bar.

4. **Recent Files**: Add a section in the File menu for quick access to recently opened images.

5. **Template Options**: Allow users to save their watermark settings as templates for quick reuse.

6. **Live Preview**: Instead of just a preview button, implement a live preview that updates as adjustments are made.

7. **Customizable Interface**: Enable users to rearrange or hide menu items according to their preferences.

8. **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide an option for users to submit feedback directly within the application for continuous improvement.

By organizing the menu thoughtfully and including these quality-of-life features, you can create a more efficient and enjoyable user experience in your watermarking application.
